# Bauhaus

Bauhaus is an [opinionated](docs/design-choices.md) set of foundational modules to optimize DevOps experience with Clojure-based services.

## Overall design

Bauhaus is a set of modules that are designed to be used together.
The modules are designed to be used with [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant),
but can be used without it.

It is the distillation of the experience of running Clojure services in production in several different organizations.

## Why "Bauhaus"?

Named after the influential design movement, Bauhaus emphasizes **functional design**, **modular composition**, and **practical utility**. Just as Bauhaus architecture focused on essential functionality without unnecessary ornamentation, this framework provides essential infrastructure without bloat.

*"Form follows function"* - applied to Clojure application architecture.

## Repository Structure

This is a **monorepo** containing multiple modules and example applications:

```
bauhaus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/                    # Reusable Bauhaus modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup/                 # Application setup utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/           # Logging infrastructure
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shutdown/          # Graceful shutdown hooks
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/               # Command-line interface
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev-tooling/           # Development utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/            # Configuration management
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build/             # Build and deployment
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ clojure-contrib/       # Clojure utility extensions
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ collection/        # Collection utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ applications/              # Example applications
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example/              # Basic Bauhaus application
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example-http-service/ # HTTP service example
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                     # Documentation
```

## Usage
There is an example application showing usage in [applications/example](applications/example) and an example http
service showing more elaborate usage in [application/example-http-service](applications/example-http-service).

See [Documentation: Intro](docs/intro.md) for a more detailed introduction utilizing the two example applications.

And while we keep bauhaus in a monorepo, this does not mean that you have to follow our path here.
You can use the modules independently, even within your git-based deps.edn dependencies.

```clojure
{:deps {...
        org.gorillalabs.bauhaus/setup-logging {:git/url   "git@github.com:gorillalabs/bauhaus.git"
                                               :git/sha   "AE...<commit sha>" ;; see https://github.com/gorillalabs/bauhaus/commits/main/
                                               :deps/root "modules/setup/logging"}
        ...
        }}
```

### Monorepo Development (Recommended)

Clone the entire repository for development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorillalabs/bauhaus.git
cd bauhaus/applications/example
```

### Individual Module Dependencies

For production applications, reference specific modules:

```clojure
{:deps {;; Core dependencies
        org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.12.0"}
        integrant/integrant {:mvn/version "0.13.1"}
        
        ;; Bauhaus modules (pick what you need)
        org.gorillalabs.bauhaus/setup-logging 
        {:git/url "https://github.com/gorillalabs/bauhaus.git"
         :git/sha "COMMIT_SHA"  ; Pin to specific commit
         :deps/root "modules/setup/logging"}
         
        org.gorillalabs.bauhaus/setup-shutdown
        {:git/url "https://github.com/gorillalabs/bauhaus.git"
         :git/sha "COMMIT_SHA"
         :deps/root "modules/setup/shutdown"}}}
```

## Development Environment

### Nix Development Environment

This project includes a [Nix flake](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) to provide a reproducible development environment.

#### Prerequisites

You must have Nix installed with flake support enabled. You can find installation instructions on the [official NixOS website](https://nixos.org/download.html).

#### Activating the Environment

Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```sh
nix develop
```

This will download all the required dependencies and drop you into a `nushell` with the following tools available:

* `jdk23`
* `clojure`
* `git`

Upon activation, it will confirm the Java and Clojure versions available in the shell.

## Contributing

3. **Follow the established patterns** in existing modules
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** as needed

## Migration from Other Frameworks

### From Mount
- Replace Mount states with Integrant components
- Use Bauhaus setup modules for logging and shutdown
- Leverage enhanced REPL workflow

### From Component
- Integrant provides similar lifecycle management
- Bauhaus adds production-ready operational modules
- Configuration management is enhanced with Aero

### From Plain Clojure
- Gradual adoption - start with one or two modules
- Enhanced REPL development experience
- Production operational capabilities
